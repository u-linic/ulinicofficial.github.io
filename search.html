  <li><span>Abrasions</span></li>
  <div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>An abrasion means that the surface layers of the skin (epidermis) has been broken. Thin-skinned bony areas (like knees, ankles and elbows) are more prone to abrasions than thicker, more padded areas. The scraped skin of an abrasion can contain particles of dirt.</p>
    <P>Tips for treating skin abrasions are:</p>
    <P>Step 1: Clean and wash your hands.</p>
    <P >Step 2: Rinse and clean the abrasion.</P>
    <P >Step 3: Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment.</P>
    <P>Step 4: Protect and cover the abrasion.</p>
    <P>Step 5: Change the dressing.</p>
    <P>Step 6: Do not pick scabs.</P>
    <P>Step 7: Check for signs of infection.</P>
    <P >Step 8: If an infection is present, antibiotics may be necessary to treat the injury.</p>
    <P >Signs of infection include:</p>
    <P >The wound is still not appearing to heal or has gotten worse, despite a few days of proper care Increasing amounts of pain The abrasion or the area surrounding it continues to remain warm, swollen or red Fever Pus, drainage or other discharge coming from the abrasion</P>

    <li><span>Bites and Sting</span></li>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <p >Most insect bites and stings are mild and can be treated at home. They might cause itching, swelling and stinging that go away in a day or two. Some bites or stings can transmit disease-causing bacteria, viruses or parasites. Stings from bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets and fire ants might cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).</p>
      <P>For mild reactions:</p>
      <P >Step 1: Move to a safe area to avoid more bites or stings.</p>
      <P>Step 2: Remove any stingers.</P>
      <P>Step 3: Gently wash the area with soap and water.</P>
      <P>Step 4: Apply a cloth dampened with cold water or filled with ice to the area of the bite or sting for 10 to 20 minutes. This helps reduce pain and swelling</p>
      <P >Step 5: If the injury is on an arm or leg, raise it</p>
      <P >Step 6: Apply to the affected area calamine lotion, baking soda paste, or 0.5% or 1% hydrocortisone cream. Do this several times a day until your symptoms go away.</P>
      <P >Step 7: Take an anti-itch medicine (antihistamine) by mouth to reduce itching. Options include nonprescription cetirizine, fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy, Children's Allegra Allergy), loratadine (Claritin).</P>
      <P>Step 8: Take a nonprescription pain reliever as needed.</p>
      <P >Seek medical care if the swelling gets worse, the site shows signs of infection or you don't feel well</p>

      <li><span>Blisters</span></li>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Blisters are small pockets of fluid that usually form in the upper layers of skin after it's been damaged. Blisters can develop anywhere on the body but are most common on the hands and feet. Fluid collects under the damaged skin, cushioning the tissue underneath</p>
        <P>How to treat Blisters:</p>
        <P>Step 1:Cover the blister. Loosely cover the blister with a bandage. Bring in the sides of the bandage so that the middle of the bandage is a little raised.</p>
        <P>Step 2:Use padding. To protect blisters in pressure areas, such as the bottom of your feet, use padding. Cut the padding into a donut shape with a hole in the middle and place it around the blister. Then, cover the blister and padding with a bandage.</P>
        <P>Step 3: Avoid popping or draining a blister, as this could lead to infection. However, if your blister is large and very painful, it may be necessary to drain the blister to reduce discomfort. To do this, sterilize a small needle using rubbing alcohol. Then, use the needle to carefully pierce one edge of the blister, which will allow some of the fluid to drain.</P>
        <P>Step 4:  Keep the area clean and covered. Once your blister has drained, wash the area with soap and water and apply petroleum jelly. Do not remove the “roof” of the blister, as this will protect the raw skin underneath as it heals.</p>

        <li><span>Thermal,Chemical or Electrical Burn</span></li>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <p >Burns due to external heat sources which raise the temperature of the skin and tissues and cause tissue cell death or charring. Hot metals, scalding liquids, steam, and flames, when coming in contact with the skin, can cause thermal burns.</p>
          <P>How is an electrical burn treated?</p>
          <P>Treatment depends on the type of skin burn you have and how serious it is.</p>
          <P>●Cool the burn - You can put a cool cloth on your burn or soak it in cool water. Do not put ice on a burn.</P>
          <P>●Cover the burn with a clean bandage - Your doctor might also recommend or prescribe a cream or ointment to soothe the skin or prevent an infection.</p>
          <P >●Treat the pain - To ease your pain, you can raise the burned part of your body above the level of your heart. For example, you can prop your foot or leg up on pillows. You can also take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</P>
          <P>●Get a tetanus shot, if it has been too many years since your last one.</p>
          <p>A severe skin burn is usually treated in the hospital. Treatments can include:</p>
          <P >●Strong pain medicines</p>

            <P >Tips for treating skin abrasions are:</p>
            <P >How to treat Contusion:</p>
            <P >1: Rest. Protect the injured area from further harm by stopping play. You may also use a protective device (i.e., crutches, sling).</P>
            <P>2: Ice. Use cold packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do not apply ice directly on the skin..</P>
            <P >3: Compression. Lightly wrap the injured area in a soft bandage or ace wrap</p>
            <P >4: Elevation. Raise the injured area to a level above the heart.</p>
            <P >Most athletes with contusions get better quickly with simple treatment measures. Your doctor may give you nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, or other medications for pain relief. Do not massage the injured area.</P>
            <P >During the first 24 to 48 hours after injury (acute phase), you will probably need to continue using rest, ice, compression bandages, and elevation of the injured area to control bleeding, swelling, and pain. While the injured muscle heals, be sure to keep exercising the uninjured parts of your body to maintain your overall level of fitness.</P>
            <P >If there is a large hematoma that does not go away within several days, your doctor may drain it surgically to expedite healing.</p>

              <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p >A laceration can be anything from a small, minor scrape to a deep, bleeding cut. In a laceration, none of the skin is missing; it's just separated. While some lacerations can seem minor, they may become serious if not treated properly and promptly.</p>
                <P >First aid for Laceration:</p>
                <P >You should call emergency hotline immediately if:</p>
                <P>1: A cut is bleeding severely.</P>
                <P >2: Blood is spurting out.</P>
                <P >3: Bleeding can't be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure.</p>
                <P >At home treatment of Laceration:</p>
                <P >Step 1: Stop the flow of blood by applying firm pressure to the laceration with a clean cloth or gauze. A small amount of blood is advantageous in cleansing the wound, but large amounts of blood loss can be dangerous.</P>
                <P >Step 2: Properly clean the wound. Remove all dirt and debris by first running cool water over the area, and then clean with a sterile cloth, warm water, and mild soap.</P>
                <P >Step 3: Apply antibiotic ointment, and then cover the wound area with a sterile gauze bandage and first-aid tape.</p>
                <P >Step 4: For a minor laceration, remove the bandage after a couple of days to promote healing.</P>
                <P >Step 5: Apply antibiotic ointment, and then cover the wound area with a sterile gauze bandage and first-aid tape.</P>
                <P >Signs of infection include:</p>
                <P >The wound is still not appearing to heal or has gotten worse, despite a few days of proper care Increasing amounts of pain The abrasion or the area surrounding it continues to remain warm, swollen or red Fever Pus, drainage or other discharge coming from the abrasion</p>

                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                      <p>A skin tear is a wound that happens when the layers of skin separate or peel back. They can happen as a result of bumping something, dressing changes, or washing or drying the skin harshly. They most often happen on the arms or legs. Skin tears are most common in newborns, the elderly and people who are chronically ill. Long-term use of steroids can also increase the risk.</p>
                      <P>How to treat Skin tears:</p>
                      <P >Step 1: Clean and wash your hands.</p>
                      <P >Step 2: Control the bleeding.</P>
                      <P>Step 3: Gently clean the wound with warm clean water.</P>
                      <P >Step 4:Gently pat dry with a clean towel.</p>
                      <P >Step 5:  If a skin flap is still attached, try to replace it by gently rolling the skin back over the wound. Do not cut the skin flap off.</p>
                      <P >Step 6: Cover the wound with a clean, non-stick pad.</P>
                      <P >Step 7: Use a stockinette instead of adhesive dressings or tapes.</P>
                      <P>Prevention</p>
                      <P>The best way to treat skin tears is to ensure they never happen in the first place. Preventative measures to practice include:</p>
                      <P>1: Use lotion on your arms and legs. Dry skin tears much more easily.</P>
                      <P>2: Drink plenty of water. This will help your skin be more elastic.</P>
                      <P>3: Make sure your home is well lit. Skin tears are often caused by bumping into your surroundings.</P>
                      <P>4: Remove any furniture or objects that block a clear path, especially around the bed and on the way to the bathroom.</P>
                      <P>5: Pad sharp corners of furniture with foam or folded cloth to soften the corners.</P>
                      <P>6: Wear long sleeve shirts and pants to your protect skin.</P>
                      <P>7: Bathe less often. Bathing too often dries the skin and makes it tear more easily.</P>
